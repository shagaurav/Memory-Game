# Memory-Game

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). 
But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!

## The styling and working of the game is good

## How The Game Works:

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. 
The game game has timer and it also counts the move.
The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Game Functionality
The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in your project. 
There are a couple of interactions that you'll need to handle:

## Flipping cards
When cards match they are matched and you have to move to the next cards to match
When cards do not match than you have to match the cards until yhey are matched
When the game finishes with all cards matched than You Won the Game and you have the option to restart the game or end the game.
